            <ul>
                <li>Know what to expect to pay when you get a prescription from your doctor</li>
                <li>Find possible generics for a branded medicine. Ask your doctor if these medicines are viable alternatives.</li>

            <p>Here are some ideas for how this application can be useful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When your doctor prescibes a medicine, quickly check on your phone for alternatives and ask whether the brand name product can be replaced with a generic.</li>
                <li>If you're on chronic medication you can periodically check to see whether the price of your meds has increased.</li>
                <li>While waiting in the queue at the pharmacy, you can look up your medicine and find out how much it will cost you and what alternatives you can ask the pharmacist for.</li>
                <li>If you look up a particular medicine often, you can bookmark the page so that you can quickly refer to it.</li>

            <p>The single exit price (SEP) mechanism in South Africa lists the maximum price that a medicine can be charged at. Dispensers may charge an additional dispensing fee depending on the price of the medicine. The Medicines and Related Substances Act allows for the following charges (excl VAT):</p>

                    {% else %}
                    <li>Otherwise the maximum dispensing fee is R{{ row.2|floatformat:2 }} + {{ row.1|mult:100}}% of the SEP.</li>
