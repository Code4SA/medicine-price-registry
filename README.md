=======================

Retail medicine prices are regulated in South Africa through the Single Exit Price Mechanism. These prices are published on a regular basis at http://www.mpr.gov.za. The information is only available in a large and unwieldy excel spreadsheet making it inaccessible to casual users. 

This projects builds and api and basic user interface to query this database. You can find a running instance at http://mpr.code4sa.org.

A typical use-case would be for a consumer to look for alternative products for a particular medicine, often generic medicines can be much cheaper than the branded product.
Another use-case allows consumers to ensure that they are not being overcharged for their medicines. This database publishes the maximum price at which a medicine can be sold. A pharmacy cannot legally increase the price of a particular medicine above the price listed here.
