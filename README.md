medicine-price-registry
=======================

Retail medicine prices are regulated in South Africa through the Single Exit Price Mechanism. These prices are published on a regular basis at http://www.mpr.gov.za. The information is only available in a large and unwieldy excel spreadsheet making it inaccessible to casual users. 

This projects builds and api and basic user interface to query this database. You can find a running instance at http://mpr.code4sa.org.
